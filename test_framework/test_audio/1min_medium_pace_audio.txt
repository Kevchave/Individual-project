The human voice:
It's the instrument we all play.
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.
It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."
And yet many people have the experience
that when they speak, people don't listen to them.
And why is that?
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
What I'd like to suggest,
there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.
I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,
but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
First, gossip.
Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.
Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well
the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
